### Abstract
My main home computer gets connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi, due to it being too far from the Internet cable entry point and therefore the router. Whenever I'm not home that same computer is suspended and I don't have access to it. I need a mechanism of waking it up, regardless of where I am. One such way is the WoWLAN protocol, though due to its somewhat paradoxical nature (the computer needs to be suspended AND maintain a Wi-Fi connection AND be able to be woken up via the Wi-Fi adapter driver), it didn't get widespread industry support and a very small amount of Wi-Fi cards support it. In thinking about this I remembered I have an old Raspberry Pi Model A which hasn't been used in quite a while, and motivated by my love of reappropriating old tech I have lying around, I decided to build a quick Python HTTP server on it, serving a webpage with a button. When the button is clicked, it'll send a magic packet to my PC and start pinging it, letting the user know of whether the computer was woken up successfully. The Raspberry has an Ethernet port, which will get connected to PC's network card and I'll use an old Wi-Fi dongle, which will expose the Pi to my Wi-Fi network.
